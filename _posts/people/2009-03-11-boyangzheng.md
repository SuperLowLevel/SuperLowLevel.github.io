I'm currently a junior-year student, a member of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, ACM Honor Class. I'm also an intern at Shanghai AI Lab, advised by Chao Dong.
In the realm of academic, I have little interest in chasing the state-of-the-art unless I have to. Instead, I prefer to explore intersting ideas that help better understanding of this field or could possibly lead to new applications. Apart from pure academic pursuit, I also devote myself to use AI for social good, such as copyright protection, fairness and so on. In this regard, I'm also a member of MIST, a project aiming to protect the copyrighted artworks.
