Performance and generalization ability are two important aspects to evaluate deep learning models. However, research on the generalization ability of Super-Resolution (SR) networks is currently absent. We make the first attempt to propose a Generalization Assessment Index for SR networks, namely SRGA. SRGA exploits the statistical characteristics of internal features of deep networks, not output images to measure the generalization ability. Specially, it is a non-parametric and non-learning metric. To better validate our method, we collect a patch-based image evaluation set (PIES) that includes both synthetic and real-world images, covering a wide range of degradations. With SRGA and PIES dataset, we benchmark existing SR models on the generalization ability. This work could lay the foundation for future research on model generalization in low-level vision.
