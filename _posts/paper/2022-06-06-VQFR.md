VQFR: There are six resolution levels, i.e., f = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}, and the quantization operation is conducted
on the feature level of f32. Each level of the encoder contains two residual blocks,
and each level of the texture branch in the decoder contains three residual blocks. Each
level of the main branch in the decoder contains one texture warping module and one
residual block. We use a bilinear upsample/downsample followed by a 1×1 convolution
to change the resolutions. VQFR has 76.3M params (1.07 TFlops) and takes 0.36s to
process a 5122
image on Nvidia A100.

Texture Warping Module (TWM): We use a 3×3 convolution with 32 output channels
to extract input information of degraded faces. Then we resize the feature to match all
resolution levels (f = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). The detailed architecture of TWM is shown in
Table. 2. For each resolution level, the offset convolution is used to generate offsets from
the concatenation of the texture feature and the input features of degraded faces. Then,
the offsets and the texture features are fed into the deformable convolution, outputting
the warped feature.
