The recurrent structure is a prevalent framework for the task
of video super-resolution, which models the temporal depen dency between frames via hidden states. When applied to
real-world scenarios with unknown and complex degrada tions, hidden states tend to contain unpleasant artifacts and
propagate them to restored frames. In this circumstance, our
analyses show that such artifacts can be largely alleviated
when the hidden state is replaced with a cleaner counterpart.
Based on the observations, we propose a Hidden State Attention (HSA) module to mitigate artifacts in real-world video
super-resolution. Specifically, we first adopt various cheap filters to produce a hidden state pool. For example, Gaussian
blur filters are for smoothing artifacts while sharpening filters
are for enhancing details. To aggregate a new hidden state that
contains fewer artifacts from the hidden state pool, we devise
a Selective Cross Attention (SCA) module, in which the attention between input features and each hidden state is calculated. Equipped with HSA, our proposed method, namely
FastRealVSR, is able to achieve 2Ã— speedup while obtaining better performance than Real-BasicVSR.
