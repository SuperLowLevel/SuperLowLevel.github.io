We introduce SUPIR (Scaling-UP Image Restoration), a groundbreaking image restoration method that harnesses
generative prior and the power of model scaling up. Leveraging multi-modal techniques and advanced generative
prior, SUPIR marks a significant advance in intelligent and realistic image restoration. As a pivotal catalyst within
SUPIR, model scaling dramatically enhances its capabilities and demonstrates new potential for image restoration. 
We collect a dataset comprising 20 million highresolution, high-quality images for model training, each enriched with descriptive text annotations. 
SUPIR provides the capability to restore images guided by textual prompts,
broadening its application scope and potential. Moreover,we introduce negative-quality prompts to further improve
perceptual quality. We also develop a restoration-guided
sampling method to suppress the fidelity issue encountered
in generative-based restoration. Experiments demonstrate
SUPIRâ€™s exceptional restoration effects and its novel capacity to manipulate restoration through textual prompts.
