Facial makeup transfer aims to translate the makeup style from a given reference makeup face image to another non-makeup one while preserving face identity. Such an instance-level transfer problem is more challenging than conventional domain-level transfer tasks, especially when paired data is unavailable. Makeup style is also different from global styles (e.g., paintings) in that it consists of several local styles/cosmetics, including eye shadow, lipstick, foundation, and so on. Extracting and transferring such local and delicate makeup information is infeasible for existing style transfer methods. We address the issue by incorporating both global domain-level loss and local instance-level loss in an dual input/output Generative Adversarial Network, called BeautyGAN. Specifically, the domain-level transfer is ensured by discriminators that distinguish generated images from domainsâ€™ real samples. The instance-level loss is calculated by pixel-level histogram loss on separate local facial regions. We further introduce perceptual loss and cycle consistency loss to generate high quality faces and preserve identity. The overall objective function enables the network to learn translation on instance-level through unsupervised adversarial learning. We also build up a new makeup dataset that consists of 3834 high-resolution face images. Extensive experiments show that BeautyGAN could generate visually pleasant makeup faces and accurate transferring results. Data and code are available at http://liusi-group.com/projects/BeautyGAN.
