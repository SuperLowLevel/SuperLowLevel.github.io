Under-Display Camera (UDC) has been widely exploited to
help smartphones realize full-screen displays. However, as the screen
could inevitably affect the light propagation process, the images captured by the UDC system usually contain flare, haze, blur, and noise.
Particularly, flare and blur in UDC images could severely deteriorate
the user experience in high dynamic range (HDR) scenes. In this paper,
we propose a new deep model, namely UDC-UNet, to address the UDC
image restoration problem with an estimated PSF in HDR scenes. Our
network consists of three parts, including a U-shape base network to
utilize multi-scale information, a condition branch to perform spatially
variant modulation, and a kernel branch to leverage the prior knowledge
of the PSF. According to the characteristics of HDR data, we additionally design a tone mapping loss to stabilize network optimization and
achieve better visual quality. Experimental results show that the proposed UDC-UNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our approach won second place in the
UDC image restoration track of the MIPI challenge.
