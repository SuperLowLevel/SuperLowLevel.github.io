Large language models are continuously innovating and evolving, with various companies racing to launch the latest versions of their models.
The emergence of GPT-4, Liama3, Claude 3.5, Sonnet, and others has shown us even more possibilities for the development of large language models.

For example, on May 14, 2024, OpenAI launched ChatGPT-4o. The 'o' in 4o stands for 'omni', meaning all-capable. It brings GPT-4 level intelligence to everyone in a very natural interactive way. While GPT-4 responses require a wait of 1-2 seconds, GPT-4o boasts a latency of about 300 milliseconds. Watching the release video of ChatGPT-4o, we can see that during the interaction, ChatGPT-4o has a strong ability to perceive emotions, can respond in real-time, and can be interrupted at any time. Furthermore, GPT-4o can 'read' equations that engineers write on paper in real-time; it doesnâ€™t just provide the answer, but explains how to solve the problem step by step.
