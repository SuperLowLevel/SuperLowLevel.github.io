Not only academic articles, people from X-Pixel often read many kinds of books. Reading & Thinking & Sharing activity is a weekly activity that encourages
us to read more and sharing the thoughts and insights. All of us read book habitually and take turns to prepare for sharing activities. These are some photos of
the Reading & Thinking & Sharing activity.
