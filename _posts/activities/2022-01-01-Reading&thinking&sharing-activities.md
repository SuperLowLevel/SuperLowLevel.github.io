Not only academic articles, people from X-Pixel often read many kinds of books. Reading & Thinking & Sharing activity is a weekly activity that encourages
us to read more and sharing thoughts and insights. All of us read books habitually and take turns to prepare for sharing activities.

In this time, Prof. Chao Dong shared with us the past records of Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought. The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in East Asian countries and the East Asian diaspora around the world. The intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy.
