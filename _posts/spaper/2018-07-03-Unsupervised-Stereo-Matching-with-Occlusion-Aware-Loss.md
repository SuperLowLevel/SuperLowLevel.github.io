Deep learning methods have shown very promising results for regressing dense disparity maps directly from stereo image pairs. However, apart from a few public datasets such as Kitti, the ground-truth disparity needed for supervised training is hardly available. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised stereo matching approach with a novel occlusion-aware reconstruction loss. Together with smoothness loss and left-right consistency loss to enforce the disparity smoothness and correctness, the deep neural network can be well trained without requiring any ground-truth disparity data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we train and test our approach without ground-truth disparity data. Competitive results can be achieved on the public datasets (Kitti Stereo 2012, Kitti Stereo 2015, Cityscape) and our self-collected driving dataset that contains diverse driving scenario compared to the public datasets.
